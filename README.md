👤 About Me

# Hi, I’m Alan

A 30-year-old Italian now back in Italy after spending several years around, Berlin and Melbourne.
I’m focused on building my skills in software development, mainly working with **Python, C++, and web technologies.**
I like experimenting, learning by doing, and creating things — and if they actually work, even better.
If not… well, at least I learned what not to do next time.

### My interests include:

- Programming (Python, C++, web dev)
- AI and technology
- DIY projects & punk-influenced design
- Language learning (besides programming languages, Portuguese)

Right now, my main priority is coding: building projects, improving my knowledge, and developing a solid foundation in tech.

#### Everything on this GitHub is part of that journey — simple, direct, and always evolving.
